# Scope

At what level do we want to capture data?

For example, we may think of APIs at resources level.
- resource level doesnt really add context, so it might not be useful

Or we may capture actions/usecase.

For the usecase, it may be composed of several steps.
- does the steps matter?
- probably not, we just need to know whether it is successful or not
- but it is useful to know which step it failed at
