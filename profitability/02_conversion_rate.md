## Prompt

How to measure conversion rate in an ecommerce database? what are the metrics that needs to be measured, and what is a good and bad conversion rate

## Response

To measure the conversion rate in an ecommerce database, you need to track the following metrics:

1. Total Visitors: The total number of unique visitors to your ecommerce website.
2. Total Conversions: The number of visitors who completed a desired action, such as making a purchase or filling out a lead form.

To calculate the conversion rate, you can use the formula:

Conversion Rate = (Total Conversions / Total Visitors) * 100

A good or bad conversion rate can vary depending on the industry, business model, and target audience. However, as a general guideline:

- A conversion rate below 1% is typically considered low.
- An average conversion rate is around 2-3%.
- A conversion rate of 5% or higher is considered good, and indicates effective website optimization and marketing strategies.

It's important to note that the definition of a good or bad conversion rate can also depend on the specific context and goals of your ecommerce business. Additionally, conversion rates can vary across different stages of the customer journey and various marketing channels. It's essential to monitor your conversion rate regularly and compare it against industry benchmarks and your own historical data to assess performance and make improvements as needed.



## Queries


Setup table users and orders.
```sql
create table users (
	id bigint generated always as identity,
	name text unique,
	primary key (id)
);

truncate table users restart identity;

insert into users(name)
select 'user-' || left(md5(n::text), 10)
from generate_series(1, 10000) n;
table users;



-- Create orders by users.
-- We assume all rows in this table is paid orders.
create table orders(
	id uuid default gen_random_uuid(),
	user_id bigint not null,
	amount bigint not null, -- in cents
	created_at timestamptz not null default current_timestamp,
	primary key(id),
	foreign key (user_id) references users(id)
);

create or replace function random_range(_min bigint, _max bigint) returns bigint as $$
	select floor(random() * (greatest(_max, _min) - least(_min, _max))) + least(_min, _max);
$$ language sql;

select random_range(10, 1000);


with seed as (
	select setseed(0.5)
), sample_users as (
	select id as user_id
	from users
	order by hashtext(name)
	limit (
		-- Just use 10% of the total users.
		select floor(count(*) * 0.1) from users
	)
)
insert into orders (
	user_id,
	amount,
	created_at
)
select
	user_id,
	random_range(50, 100000) / 10 * 10, -- 0.5 cents to 1000.00 $
	now() - make_interval (days => random_range(0, 90)::int)
from sample_users, seed;

-- Because of the way we seed, the results will always be the same.
select sum(amount) = 50258130  from orders;
```


## Measuring conversion rate

```sql
with conversions as (
	select count(distinct(user_id)) as total from orders
),
visitors as (
	select count(*) as total from users
),
conversion_rate as (
	select conversions.total::numeric / visitors.total::numeric as percent
	from conversions, visitors
)
select
	'Conversion Rate = (Total Conversions / Total Visitors) * 100' as formula,
	conversions.total as total_conversions,
	visitors.total as total_visitors,
	conversion_rate.percent as conversion_rate_percent,
	case
		when conversion_rate.percent < 0.01 then 'low'
		when conversion_rate.percent < 0.03 then 'average'
		when conversion_rate.percent < 0.05 then 'good'
		else 'excellent'
	end
from conversions, visitors, conversion_rate;
```
