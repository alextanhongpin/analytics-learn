Here is a list of useful ecommerce metrics that contribute to profitability, along with the reasons why they are important and a sample SQL query for each metric. The metrics are ranked in order of importance, with the most important ones listed first:

## Response

1. Conversion Rate:
   - Reason: Conversion rate measures the percentage of website visitors who make a purchase. A higher conversion rate indicates better efficiency in turning visitors into customers, directly impacting profitability.
   - SQL Query:
   ```sql
   SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT orders.customer_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT website_visitors.visitor_id)) * 100 AS conversion_rate
   FROM orders
   JOIN website_visitors ON orders.customer_id = website_visitors.customer_id;
   ```

2. Average Order Value (AOV):
   - Reason: AOV measures the average value of each order. Increasing the AOV can significantly impact profitability by maximizing revenue per customer.
   - SQL Query:
   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(order_total) AS average_order_value
   FROM orders;
   ```

3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV):
   - Reason: CLTV represents the predicted net profit from a customer over the entire relationship. By understanding the value of a customer, businesses can allocate resources effectively and prioritize customer retention efforts.
   - SQL Query:
   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(purchase_value * purchase_frequency / churn_rate) AS customer_lifetime_value
   FROM customers;
   ```

4. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):
   - Reason: CAC measures the average cost of acquiring a new customer. Keeping CAC low is crucial for profitability as it determines how much investment is required to gain customers.
   - SQL Query:
   ```sql
   SELECT (marketing_costs / new_customers) AS customer_acquisition_cost
   FROM marketing;
   ```

5. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS):
   - Reason: ROAS measures the effectiveness of advertising campaigns by comparing the revenue generated to the cost of the ads. It helps optimize ad spending and maximize profitability.
   - SQL Query:
   ```sql
   SELECT (revenue_generated / ad_cost) AS return_on_ad_spend
   FROM advertising;
   ```

6. Gross Profit Margin:
   - Reason: Gross profit margin calculates the percentage of revenue that remains after deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS). Monitoring and improving the gross profit margin helps optimize pricing, sourcing, and inventory management.
   - SQL Query:
   ```sql
   SELECT ((total_revenue - COGS) / total_revenue) * 100 AS gross_profit_margin
   FROM sales;
   ```

7. Cart Abandonment Rate:
   - Reason: Cart abandonment rate measures the percentage of users who add items to their shopping carts but do not complete the purchase. By reducing cart abandonment, businesses can increase revenue and improve profitability.
   - SQL Query:
   ```sql
   SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT abandoned_carts) / COUNT(DISTINCT initiated_carts)) * 100 AS cart_abandonment_rate
   FROM carts;
   ```

8. Average Customer Retention Rate:
   - Reason: Average customer retention rate indicates the percentage of customers who continue to make purchases over time. Higher customer retention leads to repeat sales, increased customer lifetime value, and improved profitability.
   - SQL Query:
   ```sql
   SELECT (1 - (COUNT(DISTINCT churned_customers) / COUNT(DISTINCT total_customers))) * 100 AS average_customer_retention_rate
   FROM customers;
   ```
