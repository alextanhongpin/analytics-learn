## Response from Bard


Sure, here is a table of useful metrics for ecommerce, along with the formula and why the metric is important:

| Metric | Formula | Importance |
|---|---|---|
| Conversion rate | (Number of conversions / Number of visitors) x 100 | This metric measures the percentage of visitors who take a desired action, such as making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter. A high conversion rate means that your website is effective at converting visitors into customers. |
| Average order value | (Total revenue / Number of orders) | This metric measures the average amount of money that each customer spends when they make a purchase. A high average order value means that your customers are spending more money on each visit. |
| Return on investment (ROI) | (Total revenue from marketing campaigns - Total cost of marketing campaigns) / Total cost of marketing campaigns | This metric measures the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns. A high ROI means that your marketing campaigns are generating sales that are worth more than the cost of running the campaigns. |
| Customer lifetime value (CLV) | (Average order value x Average number of orders per customer x Average customer lifespan) | This metric measures the total amount of money that a customer is expected to spend with your business over their lifetime. A high CLV means that your customers are likely to continue doing business with you for a long time. |
| Net promoter score (NPS) | (% of Promoters - % of Detractors) | This metric measures customer loyalty. A high NPS means that your customers are likely to recommend your business to their friends and family. |

These are just a few of the many useful metrics that you can track for your ecommerce business. By tracking these metrics, you can make informed decisions about how to allocate your marketing budget, improve your website, and increase your sales.
